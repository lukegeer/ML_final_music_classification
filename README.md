# ML_final_music_classification
Exploring musical classification through dimensionality reduction.

## Overview
Explored musical genre classification using audio feature extraction and dimensionality reduction.
Used specialized software to decompose tracks into musical components (e.g., vocals, bass, guitar) for detailed feature analysis. Applied PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP to visualize genre separability and evaluate clustering quality. Compared multiple classifiers (k-NN, Random Forest) on both raw and reduced feature sets to assess performance.
